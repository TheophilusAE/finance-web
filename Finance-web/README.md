## About Finapp

Finapp is a web application designed for UMKM owners with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe financial management must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Finapp takes the pain out of financial tracking by easing common tasks used in many financial projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://finapp.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://finapp.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://finapp.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://finapp.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://finapp.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://finapp.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://finapp.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://finapp.com/docs/broadcasting).

Finapp is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
